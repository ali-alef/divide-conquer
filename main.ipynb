    "# MERGE SORT\n",
    "Merge Sort is a recursive algorithm that continuously splits the array in half until it cannot be further divided\n",
    "the array has only one element left (an array with one element is always sorted).\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "*T(n) = 2T(n/2) + θ(n)* \n",

    "#### Advantages of Merge Sort\n",
    "* Stability: Merge sort is a stable sorting algorithm, which means it maintains the relative order of equal elements in the input array.\n",

    "* Space complexity: Merge sort requires additional memory to store the merged sub-arrays during the sorting process.\n",
