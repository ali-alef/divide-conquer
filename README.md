# Divide and Conquer Algorithms

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook discussing various Divide and Conquer algorithms. These algorithms are powerful problem-solving techniques that break down complex problems into simpler subproblems, solve them independently, and combine their solutions to solve the original problem efficiently.

## Introduction

Divide and Conquer is a paradigm used in algorithm design where a problem is divided into smaller subproblems that are solved independently. These solutions are then combined to solve the original problem. The goal of this repository is to provide a comprehensive overview of various Divide and Conquer algorithms along with their explanations.

## Algorithms Included

The following Divide and Conquer algorithms are covered in this Jupyter notebook:

1. **Binary Search**: Efficiently finds a target value within a sorted array.
2. **Merge Sort**: Sorts an array by dividing it into halves, sorting each half, and then merging the sorted halves.
3. **Quick Sort**: Sorts an array by selecting a pivot element, partitioning the array, and recursively sorting the subarrays.
4. **Strassen's Matrix Multiplication**: Multiplies two matrices efficiently using a recursive algorithm.
5. **Maximum Contiguous Subarray**: Finds the subarray with the largest sum in a given array.
6. **Power of Number**: Calculates the power of a number using the Divide and Conquer technique.
7. **Fibonacci Number**: Computes the nth Fibonacci number using the Divide and Conquer approach.

Each algorithm is accompanied by detailed explanations, implementation code, and complexity analysis.
